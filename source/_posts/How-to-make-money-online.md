I have been working as a software engineer for more than 10 years. As I have a full-time job, it is not really a problem to make the money that is needed to support my family.

But one day a question suddenly came into my mind. What if I lose my job and no one wants to hire me anymore? Can I make a living or even make a fortune with the skills and knowledge I have?

So I started to do my research. After searching on Google and Youtube, I got a list of possible ways to make money using computer skills. Here are my list and my initial thought about each idea. I am going to further look into some of these ideas later.

## Freelancer

Obviously, the first problem (maybe the biggest one) is how to get your first client. I do not have any idea about that.

## Crowdsourcing

This is something new to me. Further investigation is needed.

## Self-media

The business model is simple. First, you have a web site, a blog or a Youtube channel. Then you have a lot of visitors. And finally, you can make money by advertisement or something like Amazon.com Associates.

Yes, you are right. That's why I start this blog.

## Writing

You can start with a blog and then you may write a book. Now there is some service online to make it possible for a person to publish a book by himself/herself.

## To build a niche app or plugin

This idea usually requires you to target a relatively small group of people that have specific requirements. As the market is too small for a regular business, an individual developer may take the chance.

## To take part in competitions and win rewards

It can be an online competition like Kaggle or local Hackathons. Obviously, you need to be very good to win

## To provide online courses

It appears to me that you need to be really good at something special. Because if you provide a course such as "Introduction to Python programming", it is hard to stand out from hundreds of similar courses.

## e-commerce

You can sell something or some service. Here I heard of a new concept "drop shipping", I need to look into it.

## Financial investment

Someone say that programming skills can help you to gain profit in the traditional financial market. I do not believe it is that easy.


Here is just the collection of all the ideas I got so far. I am going to try some of them and update my finds in my blog. Stay tuned!
