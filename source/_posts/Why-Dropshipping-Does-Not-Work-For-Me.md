In my [last post](/2019/04/27/How-to-make-money-online), I listed several ways to make money online. I also mentioned that a new concept, __drop shipping__, came to my mind during my research. This week, I further looked into this business model.

Unfortunately, although its advocators claim that it is a business model with low barriers to entry and can easily bring you thousands (if not millions) of dollars, my conclusion is that drop shipping is not a good idea for me.

Here are my reasons.

# No Silver Bullet!!!

In software engineering, "[no silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet)" means there is no single technology that can ease software development. I believe it also applies to business. No single business model can make everyone rich!

If drop shipping is really a method by which one can easily make a huge amount of money, everyone will start to do it until the business is no longer profitable.

We shall bear in mind that anyone who tells you how successful he/she is in drop shipping may be affected by [Survivorship Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). Their success does not guarantee your success!

# It requires time and experience

But don't take me wrong. I still believe drop shipping is a good business model if you want to have a [__lean startup__](https://amzn.to/2Jy3NTKt). But you can be successful only if you have the knowledge and experience required and you are willing to spend enough time and effort in it.

As I understand, doing drop shipping is actually doing marketing and customer service. Neither of these two jobs is easy. They both require experience and time.

What I am looking for is something that can accumulate my effort made in spare time. Obviously, a drop shipping business is not such a thing.

# You need to spend money

This may surprise drop shipping beginners. You really need to spend some money before you can make money from drop shipping.

In theory, you can just spend $10 to get a cheap domain name and spend another $29 to have a Shopify store. Then you can list some goods from Aliexpress. Now you post something on Twitter/Facebook/Instagram to tell your friends that you have a fancy online store. If you are lucky enough, someone will place an order and you just start to make money.

But in fact, no one will notice your online store. Actually, you would hope no one notices it because it is so ugly that it will become a joke among your friends.

According to some drop a [drop shipping expert](https://www.dropshipdownunder.com.au/blog/the-costs-of-starting-a-dropshipping-business), you need $500 - $1000 to build a decent online store. This is just a start. To get enough visitors to bring you sustainable profit, you need to continuously spend money (about $300) in marketing every month. Furthermore, you must be patient because you may not have any profit for the first 3-4 months even if you spend that much money.

# Just not for me

In conclusion, drop shipping is not a good part-time job or side project for me. The main reason is that I do not have the experience and I do not want to spend that much time and money in it.

But I have to emphasize that drop shipping is a good business model for those who really take it seriously and want to start his/her own business.
